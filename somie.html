        <h1>About Me</h1>
    
        <p> Hello there! My name is Duncan Ndegwa . I'm a passionate and dedicated computer science graduate with a keen interest in leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. Armed with a solid foundation in computer science principles, I have honed my skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, as well as gained practical experience in software development and system design.<br><br>
            During my academic journey, I undertook challenging projects that not only enhanced my problem-solving abilities but also exposed me to a diverse range of technologies, including databases, web development, and artificial intelligence. My in-depth knowledge of algorithms and data structures empowers me to craft efficient and scalable solutions to real-world challenges. <br> <br>
            I have worked as an ICT trainer, and during that time I have developed a strong understanding of the most effective teaching methods and strategies. I am well-versed in using technology to enhance learning, and I am confident in my ability to engage and motivate students. I am also experienced in creating and implementing lesson plans, and I am confident in my ability to adapt to the needs of each student. I also worked as an IT support technician. <br><br>
